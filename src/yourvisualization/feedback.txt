As a reminder, I want to know how well a visualization that you've imagined in your mind can be realized using the abstractions in my system, e.g.:

- labeling parts of code
- using those labels to define interesting points in the code's execution
- drawing on the visualization canvas using expressions that reference variables from the program at those points in execution
- setting transition properties to customize animation between those points


With this in mind, please try to record any feedback you have while creating your visualization, including:

- what tasks (e.g., drawing an array, adding "steps", changing the size of an item over time) are hard or tricky to complete (or alternatively, anything you wish was easier):

- any tasks that were easier than you expected:

- anything that you wanted to do, but couldn't (because the system does not support it, or because it would take too much time):

- any design patterns that you discovered or liked (examples provided in the next section):

- what you had to learn beyond the content in the instructions document (e.g., probably some CSS stuff):

- how you were able to animate something in a way that you wouldn't have been able to without the system, or perhaps a new way you learned to think about algorithm visualizations:

- anything else:


Other kinds of feedback that I'm interested in, but aren't as helpful for my thesis:

- reports of bugs in the system
- issues with syntax (e.g., putting Javascript in JSON is gross, Java labels can be a bit clunky)
- issues with drawing or layout that are overly specific to HTML/CSS (e.g., flexbox layout is hard, or "i want to draw a triangle but can't")
- requests for more types of views/transitions
- requests for supporting other data structures/languages/language features
- requests for quality-of-life features (e.g., notifications for trace file generation success)


You can give me your feedback by either adding it to this file and pushing it to your fork of the repo or by sending it to me on Slack/Discord (ideally with your Java and visualization JSON file), or by telling it to me verbally in a Calendly meeting if you prefer that.
